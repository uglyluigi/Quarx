# Website for QUARX

This is the repository containing the website for a band named Quarx, whom'st is based out of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

## Feature Goals

* Mailing list, both SMS and email, to inform those who want to sign up of events/locations for Quarx performances
* Control panel for composing/editing/posting blog posts
* Home page that displays lots of information including blog posts/twitter timeline/whatever else we want

## TODO

* Actually use DB schema instead of using the MongoDB node client directly, because that's kind of ratchet
* Populate each component with appropriate content
* Formalize style guidelines to make our site have the cleanest fit in the west
* Collect fat pay check in the form of a good grade in this class
